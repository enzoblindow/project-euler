    # Assumptions:
    # 1. The Mercedes SL230 has a rear-wheel drive with the engine located at the front of the car.
    # 2. The fuel tank is usually located at the rear of the car, over or near the rear axle.
    # 3. The cargo in the back trunk is also over or near the rear axle.
    # 4. The driver and passenger are seated in the front, which is also over the front axle.
    
    # Constants
    total_weight = 1000  # in kg
    driver_weight = 100  # in kg
    passenger_weight = 65  # in kg
    fuel_weight = 60  # in kg
    cargo_weight = 100  # in kg
    scale_height_difference = 5 / 100  # converting scale height difference to meters
    
    # Weight distribution assumptions based on car model and typical layout
    front_weight = driver_weight + passenger_weight  # front axle weight
    rear_weight = total_weight - front_weight  # rear axle weight
    rear_weight += fuel_weight + cargo_weight  # additional weight over the rear axle due to fuel and cargo
    
    # Calculating the effect of the scale height difference
    additional_rear_weight = (rear_weight / (rear_weight + front_weight)) * scale_height_difference
    
    # Total weight on the scale (right two wheels)
    weight_on_scale = rear_weight + additional_rear_weight
